# Project Images Directory

Store your high-resolution project images here.

## How to use
1. Add your image files (JPG, PNG, WEBP) to this folder.
2. In your code, reference them using the absolute path starting with `/projects/`.

**Example:**
If you add an image named `luxury-villa.jpg` here, you can use it in an `img` tag like this:

```jsx
<img src="/projects/luxury-villa.jpg" alt="Luxury Villa Design" />
```

## Tips
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `modern-kitchen-01.jpg` instead of `IMG_001.jpg`) for better SEO and maintainability.
- Try to use optimized formats like WebP when possible for faster loading.
